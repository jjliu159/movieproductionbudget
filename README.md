# Movie Production Budget
This project is my attempt to help the movie production industry by setting a production budget standard based on different genres. The standard was generated from training and testing a linear regression model.  

## How to use 
The file is in a .ipynb format, it's best if you use google colab (that's what was used)

The movie_dataset.csv, although not in this Github (too large to upload), is necessary. The .csv file was grabbed from Kaggle, here's the link for where it's from: **https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset**
